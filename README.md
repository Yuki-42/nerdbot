# Nerdbot

Made because someone called me a nerd on the internet, and I wanted to prove them right.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it
3. Install `python-dotenv` and run `pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord`
4. Create a `.env` file and add the following: `TOKEN=your_token_here`
5. Run the first time setup with `python3 setup.py`
6. Run the bot with `python3 bot.py` or `sh start.sh` if you're on a unix system (or WSL)
7. Profit (not really)
